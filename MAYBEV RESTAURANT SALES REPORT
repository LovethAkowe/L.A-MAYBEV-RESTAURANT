Observations

TOTAL SALE BY ITEM NAME

Sandwiches generated the highest revenue at $65,820, making them the top product. Frankie and Cold Coffee follow closely with $57,500 and $54,440 respectively. Non-beverage items seem to dominate the top revenue spots. Lesser-known items likely contribute to lower long-tail revenue.
 TOP 5 BEST SELLING ITEMS (by Quantity)

Cold Coffee leads with 1,361 units sold—popularity in volume and value. Sugarcane Juice and Panipuri are strong performers, indicating beverage and street food demand. High quantity does not always mean high revenue—check pricing structures. Cold beverages dominate the top-sellers list.
MONTHLY SALES TREND

January had the highest revenue ($28,670), followed by February and March. A slight but consistent downward trend is visible over 3 months. Seasonal or post-holiday effects might influence January’s spike. No drastic drops suggest stable customer retention. Average monthly sales hover around $26,000.6. Decline might be attributed to reduced promotional efforts. Customer inflow appears steady, albeit with minor fluctuations.
DAILY TIME SEGMENT

Night is the most profitable segment ($62,075). Afternoon and Morning follow with $56,345 and $53,730 respectively. Even distribution suggests demand across all dayparts. Night peak may be due to leisure dining or late shifts. Morning is slightly lower, potentially due to limited menu or timing. Evening gap suggests potential for happy hour promotions. No severe drop-offs indicate consistent day-long business.
PAYMENT METHOD DISTRIBUTION.

Cash leads at $148,650, slightly ahead of Online at $126,580. Online payments still represent a large share (46%). Cash dominance may hint at customer habits or technology access.
REVENUE BY CUSTOMER

Males contributed $143,720; Females close behind at $131,510.2. Revenue distribution is fairly balanced (52% vs 48%). Indicates a diverse and gender-balanced customer base.
ITEM TYPE BY TRANSACTION AMOUNT

Fast Food dominates with $188,840 vs Beverages at $86,390. Fast Food contributes nearly 69% of total revenue. Beverages, while high in quantity, earn less revenue.
 

RECOMMENDATION

Focus marketing and upselling efforts on top 3 performers. Bundle low-performing items with top-selling items to boost their visibility. Consider promotions on mid-tier sellers to improve their traction.Monitor inventory for top sellers to avoid stockouts. Explore adding variants of Sandwich and Frankie to leverage popularity. Introduce combo deals involving high-selling items.
 TOP 5 BEST SELLING ITEMS (by Quantity)

I recommend that the executives explore premium pricing or larger-size options for best-selling beverages and also consider a loyalty reward program around high-quantity items. Promote high-quantity but lower-value items with minimal cost add-ons. Analyze margins on top-sellers to ensure profitability.5. Enhance visibility of lesser-known snacks with high volume potential. Introduce seasonal twists to beverages to maintain interest. Use high-sellers to draw footfall and cross-sell other items.
MONTHLY SALES TREND

Investigate promotions or events in January to replicate success. Maintain visibility and momentum post-peak months. Launch limited-time offers in slower months to boost sales. Use monthly performance to adjust inventory and staff scheduling. Monitor weather or seasonal festivals that impact footfall. Consider monthly themes (e.g., “February Freshness”) to sustain excitement. Track marketing ROI to align campaigns with monthly performance.
DAILY TIME SEGMENT

Enhance staff presence and resources during night shift. Test breakfast bundles or morning combos to boost early sales. Introduce twilight specials to bridge afternoon-night gaps. Use time-specific discounts to influence traffic. Adjust product availability by time (e.g., lighter breakfast). Introduce delivery options for late-night customers.
PAYMENT METHOD DISTRIBUTION.

Promote online payments via discounts or loyalty points. Ensure systems can handle both payment types smoothly. Track payment mode per item to assess patterns.
REVENUE BY CUSTOMER

I recommend that the managers design gender-targeted marketing campaigns. Study item preferences by gender for tailored upselling. Offer loyalty programs for both male and female customers. Avoid gender-stereotypical promotions—focus on behavior-based.
ITEM TYPE BY TRANSACTION AMOUNT

Promote beverages alongside fast food for combo sales. Reevaluate pricing of beverages to maximize returns. Consider upselling beverage size/customizations. Identify beverages with best margins and promote them. Test fast food + drink bundles to improve beverage revenue.
CONCLUSION

The first quarter of 2022 presents a solid performance trajectory for Maybev Restaurant. Key menu categories performed well, across different daily time segments.
